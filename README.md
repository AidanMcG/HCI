Part 2 of the project is broken up into two components. The deadline for this assignment is 23:55 on Friday 8th December 2017. . What is required for part two of the assignment is:
a working prototype of your UI;
A report detailing how you tested and validated your prototype UI. I am interested in reading here of the steps you have taken to test with users, or using heuristic methods, to determine the usability of the UI. I am also interested in the types of unit tests you have run. what framework (if any) did you choose? Why did you test some things and not others? I am particularly interested in issues which the testing threw up, and what you did/would do in order to fix them. You will also be marked on the manner and thoroughness of the evaluations. How systematic have you been? This report should not be long; about 750-1000 words per person will suffice. You need not use long paragraphs, bullet points and tables may be used extensively. Also, the word counts are just intended as guidelines. What I do not wish to see is a 500 word report from any group. You should use the submission form which forms part of this brief to submit the assignment. Details of how to submit are given on that page.
Part 1 of this assignment (the presentation) will be worth 40% of the marks available for continuous assessment, or 20% of your overall module grade. part 2 will comprise the remaining 50% of the marks available for continuous assessment, or 25% of your overall grade.
